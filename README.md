# Outside Light Timer
This is a micro controlled timer for turning on outside lights on a schedule.

The timer will have one or two timer cycles. This is so you can set a period of darkness in the middle of the night.

The timer will have a web server that will provide the user interface for setting the timer.

The timer will have the novas python module to get the sunrise, sunset, twilight start and twilight end times. This will allow the timer to adjust for seasonal lighting changes.

The timer will be based on an ESP8266 micro controller using MicroPython.
